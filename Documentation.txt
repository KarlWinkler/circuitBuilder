    snapLink: this snaps your selection to the grid. stops you from clicking on unsnapped nodes
    continuousLink: when two nodes are connected only the first node that was selected will be deselected (TODO)
    multiLink: the first node selected will not be unlinked unless you click away (TODO)
  Delete: delete a node
  Resistor: place a resistor node that can be connected to other nodes with the link tool (max connections = 2
  VoltageSrc: places a voltage source in the vertical orientation which can be connected to two other nodes
    rotated: places horizontally instead
  CurrentSrc: places a current source in the vertical orientation which can be connected to two other nodes
    rotated: places horizontally instead
